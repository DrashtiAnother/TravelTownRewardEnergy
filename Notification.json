    "des1": "Your items may get split in two, but your fun will double!\n\nThe handy Splitter feature allows you to divide an item into two from the previous level, making it easier to fulfill your orders and earn rewards. If you accidentally split an item, simply click on the ‘undo’ button to reverse it.\n\nYou can earn Splitters through game activities like events, daily task missions, level upgrades, and more, so keep playing to increase your chances.\n\n✈️ Travel Tip: Feeling like your item is a bit too advanced? You can use more than one Splitter to keep breaking it down until it's just right for you to complete your order. 👌\n\n🚧 Heads Up, Travelers: While this trusty Splitter is magnificent at helping you complete orders, it may not work on the unique items released during special events. We just wanted you to keep that in mind the next time something brand new comes to town! 🤠\n\nLet’s make like a banana and split!",

The Producers Inventory is a great way to do that!\n\nThe Producers Inventory is there to store the max-level Producers you’re not currently using. More slots will unlock 🔓 as you level up ⬆️.\n\n- If your max-level Producer is already a part of your Items Inventory, it will automatically get moved to the Producers Inventory when its slot becomes available.\n- If the Producer is on your main board, it will stay there until you drag it to the Producers Inventory.\n- If you ever need the Producer back from your inventory, just tap on it to bring it back to the main board - super easy!\n\nBetween the Producers Inventory and inventory for items and tools, there’s no need to worry about overcrowding! 🙌",
